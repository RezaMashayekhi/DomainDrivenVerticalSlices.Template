# Domain Layer

The Domain layer is at the heart of the application, encapsulating the business logic and rules of the system. It is designed following domain-driven design (DDD) principles to ensure that the business domain is accurately represented and that the application's core functionality is aligned with business requirements.

## Key Components

### Entities
Entities are the primary objects within the domain, each with a unique identifier. Examples include `Entity1`, which represents a core domain concept.

### Events
Events signify important changes or actions within the domain. For instance, `Entity1CreatedEvent` indicates the creation of `Entity1`.

### Value Objects
Value Objects are objects that do not have a unique identifier and are used to describe aspects of the domain. An example is `ValueObject1`, which could represent a quantity, a monetary value, or any other attribute that is important within the domain.

## Working with the Domain

The Domain layer is structured to be isolated from infrastructure concerns, focusing solely on representing and enforcing business rules. When extending the domain:

1. **Entities** should be extended or added to model new concepts or behaviors needed by the application.
2. **Events** should be created to represent new significant occurrences that domain entities can trigger.
3. **Value Objects** should be utilized to encapsulate and enforce invariants for attributes shared among entities.

## Extending the Domain

To add a new entity, event, or value object to the domain, follow the established patterns found within each category. Ensure that new additions are accompanied by appropriate unit tests to maintain the integrity and correctness of the domain model.
