# Application Layer

The Application layer serves as the core of our business logic, orchestrating the application's behavior through commands, queries, and events. It's structured to support a clean architecture, ensuring that our domain logic is separate from infrastructure concerns.

## Key Components

- **Commands and Queries**: Define the operations that can be performed in the application, such as creating, updating, and retrieving entities.
- **Events**: Handle application-wide events, facilitating decoupled components interaction.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Serve as the data structure for transferring data between the application layer and other layers.
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts for repository interactions, ensuring abstraction over concrete data access implementations.
- **Mappings**: Automate the mapping between domain entities and DTOs, simplifying data transformations.
- **Pipeline Behaviors**: Interceptors that add cross-cutting concerns to MediatR request handling, such as logging and validation.

## Pipeline Behaviours

### LoggingBehaviour

This component is designed to automatically log the execution of commands and queries. It works by wrapping around the handling process, logging key details about the request and its result. Sensitive information is intentionally omitted to respect privacy concerns.

### ValidationBehaviour

Ensures that incoming requests comply with business rules by integrating with FluentValidation for automatic validation of commands and queries.

## Extending or Customizing Behaviours

Customization is straightforwardâ€”adjust logging details in `LoggingBehaviour` or modify validation rules in `ValidationBehaviour` as necessary. This flexibility allows tailoring behavior to meet specific requirements.

## Setting Up the Application Layer

The `ApplicationExtensions` class simplifies the setup of the application layer, including the registration of MediatR, AutoMapper, and our custom pipeline behaviors. Here's how to use it in your application startup:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddApplication();
}
```

This method ensures that all necessary components of the Application layer are correctly configured and ready to use.
